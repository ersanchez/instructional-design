# Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes

This is a brainstormed (very unorganized and probably inaccurate) listing of stuff people need to be able to do, stuff people should know, and attitudes people should have before embarking on the Linux From Scratch journey.

This list will form the basis for a much more organized task analysis sometime in the future. This list will also form the basis for a listing of prerequisite knowledge and skills one should have before beginning.
