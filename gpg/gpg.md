# GnuPG Tutorial Brainstorming

This is a rough sketch of what users need to know to start using GnuPG.

Note: Like all things, there is an easy way and the hard way. The easy way involves using the FSF's guide to using Enigmail and GnuPG. The hard way, my way, is to understand the operations and implications of the various choices you can make in using GnuPG.
