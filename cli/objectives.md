# Objectives

The objectives follow the ABCD model where:

* A is the **audience**
* B is the observable **behavior** that the learner will be able to demonstrate
* C is the **condition** under with the learning will happen
* D is the **degree** of performance the learner will demonstrate

The objectives are all written for the audience described below:

>This course is intended for computer users who are experienced using the graphical user interface to perform basic tasks (create/delete files and directories, more around the filesystem, etc.) who are now required to perform those basic tasks using only the command line without a graphical user interface.

## Cognitive Objectives

* recall the purpose of the command line
* describe the difference between the command line and a graphical user interface
* describe the scenarios in which the command line is useful
* recall the purpose of the terminal emulator application
* recall that unix-like systems are case-sensitive
* describe the layout of the unix directory tree
* explain the difference between copying and moving a file
* explain the condition a directory must be in normally before deleting it
* identify the major components of the default Bash prompt
* identify the part of the Bash prompt that changes when you change directory

## Performance Objectives

* C **condition** will be "Given a computer with a terminal emulator,"
* D **degree** will be "with no errors"
