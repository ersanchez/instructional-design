# Licensing Overview

## Why this is important

Anyone who uses works created by others needs to know some basic facts surrounding copyright and licensing. It is important to make sure that sufficient rights are obtained from the creator of the work before using it.

[Copyright law (U.S. Code &sect; 504)][copy] states that "...an infringer of copyright is liable for either (1) the copyright owner's actual damages ...or (2) statuatory damages." These statuatory damages can go up to $150,000 per infringement. Attornees fees are added on top of that.

## Copyright vs. Licensing

* **Copyright** - rights held by the author/creator of an original work
* **License** - rights and privileges that a copyright holder grants to an end user

Using copyrighted material without a license could result in a lawsuit which could cost your organization a lot of money.

Make sure all multimedia you use in your materials have a permissive license or make sure you have purchased a license to the works.

## Copyright and Creation

Works are automatically protected by copyright when they are created - even if not explicitly indicated. It is automatic.

Copyright lasts [according to the U.S. Copyright Office][last] "...the life of the author plus and additional 70 years." There are also different time spans based on anonymous works and based on when the work was published.

## Licence Types for Multimedia

* Limited Use
* Creative Commons - some restrictions
* Public domain- no restrictions

## Limited Use

This license type is used when the content owner wants to restrict what the end user can do with the work. 

As an example, a site like [iStockPhoto.com][istock] may use a license that defines certain limitations of use. The licensee can specify terms such as:

* how many times the work can be used
* whether or not the work can be sold
* how the work can be used
* medium in which the work can be used
* time period
* number of employees who can use the work (individual vs. multi-seat)
* using the work in a logo
* whether you can use the work after your license runs out
* audit / certificat of compliance - provide a list of "projects or end uses that contain licensed content"

For example, check out this statement about when you can use stockpiled images from [iStockPhoto.com][ilic]:

> "...subscription licenses only remain valid if you use your file in a project within 30 days of your subscription ending"

Here is another confusingly-worded restriction from [eLearningBrothers][ebros] in their Stock Library Subscription Users section:

> "Licensee's users shall not print, sell or use the image for any marketing, advertising, logo, social media or any website purposes."

Here is another blurb from [eLearningBrothers][multi] about multi-users:

> "...if you purchased a 1-user license, then only one designer is allowed to access and download templates. Also, only 1 designer is allowed to use the templates to create content."

## Staying out of Trouble

Avoid violating copyright law by following these steps:

* Check who owns the work
* Ask for permission to use the work
* Buy a license (if required)
* Provide attribution ...more on this later on
* Use it responsibly

Note: these steps are based on Pacada's presentation noted in the References section.



## Creative Commons (CC)

* Different levels of rights granted to the end user

### CC License Adders

The following adders can be used to fine tune the rights that a copyright holder can grant to an end user. They are listed from most-free to most-limiting.

* **Public Domain (CC0)** - Creator allows full freedom to use the work in any way the end user sees fit - not limited at all.
* **Attribution (BY)** - Ok to copy, distribute, display, perform as long as creator is credited
* **Share-Alike (SA)** - Any derivative works must use the same license type as the original content
* **Non-Commercial (NC)** - ok to copy, distribute, display, perform ...**NOT OK** to sell
* **No Derivatives (ND)** - Ok only to use verbatim copies - no changes are authorized

Combinations of these adders can be used to fine-tune the rights granted to the end user. 

Examples:

* CC0
* CC-BY
* CC-BY-SA
* CC-BY-NC
* CC-BY-ND
* CC-BY-NC-SA
