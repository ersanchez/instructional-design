# Introduction - WIIFM

* Have you ever taught a course where there was no interaction whatsoever?
* Have you ever gone through an entire class without asking questions?
* Have you asked questions but only give the learners a millisecond to think of what to answer?
* Do you answer your own questions before your learners can give an answer?

You're doing it wrong!

The good news is that you can make your classes more interactive and increase student learning by doing one thing: **WAITING!!!***

# Wait Times

This short course will help you learn the benefits of using wait times when you ask questions in class.

**What the heck is a wait time?**

There are two main wait times that you can use when asking questions in class:

## Wait Time \#1

Wait time number 1 is the time after you finish asking your question until your learners respond.

## Wait Time \#2

Wait time number 2 is the time after a learner provides an answer before you say or do anything about that learner's answer.

## Benefits of Wait Times

Studies have shown that using wait times leads to:

* more responses
* better responses
* better comprehension
* a slower class pace that may be easier for everyone to follow
* learners listening more closely to each other
* more time for learners to think
* less failed answers
* more time to apply logic
* weaker students interacting more

# Implementing Wait Times

Here is an example flow of a question and answer sequence:

1. Ask your question
2. Begin wait time \#1
3. Get a learner response
4. Begin wait time \#2
5. Provide feedback

# Detailed Description of Using Wait Times

## Ask Your Question

* Ask a prepared question that is answerable.
* SHUT UP!!!
* Seriously, don't say a thing. 
* Don't make a face. 
* Be passive.
* Saying anything after you ask your question will mess everything up!

## Begin Wait Time \#1

* It will be awkward.
* You will feel really weird.
* You may actually hear real crickets chirping!

### It Is Important

Many things are going through the learners' minds right after you ask your question. They are:

* analyzing your question
* combining knowledge together 
* evaluating information 
* gathering courage to answer
* trying to avoid your gaze

You will be _soooo_ tempted to say something during this awkward silence. DON'T! You'll mess up your learners' thoughts. Just be quiet!

## Get a Learner Response

Some learner (hopefully many) will start to raise their hands to answer the question. The awkward silence might even compell one or more of them to blurt out an answer unprompted.

If all you see is raised hands, call on someone.

## Begin Wait Time \#2

Do not react to the learner's response.

* Don't make a face.
* Don't say anything.
* Be passive.
* Be silent!
* **Do not provide any indication** of the learner being right or wrong.
* Embrace the awkwardness again - this is tough!

### Students Will Keep Thinking

Shut your mouth and watch this happen.

The original answerer will most likely:

* add to their original answer
* explain their answer
* _maybe even_ change their answer
* defend their answer

Other learners will 

* listen to the answer provided
* decide to agree or disagree with it
* formulate an alternative answer
* add to the original answer
* debate the original responder (yes!)
* backup the original responder

You will:

* listen to the discussion
* have time to formulate a response tailored to the discussion
* enjoy hearing your class almost teach itself!

Boom! Your class just got interactive. 

## Provide Feedback

Follow up on the answer provided. 

Provide an answer or redirect to another learner to answer. 

# Conclusion

The simple act of waiting has many benefits for your learners. Start waiting! 

Prepare your questions ahead of class. 

Don't try to "wing it" - you will suck. Your learners will suffer.

Once you get past the awkwardness and realize that your learners are actually _learning_ you will want to ask more questions and wait longer. Like magic, you'll get more learners reinforcing and guiding each other toward better learning.

Now, go share this with someone else!
