# Introduction - WIIFM

* Have you ever taught a course where there was no interaction whatsoever?
* Have you ever gone through an entire class without asking questions?
* Have you asked questions but only give the learners a millisecond to think of what to answer?
* Do you answer your own questions before your learners can give an answer?

You're doing it wrong!

The good news is that you can make your classes more interactive and increase student learning by doing one thing: **WAITING!!!***

# Wait Times

This short course will help you learn the benefits of using wait times when you ask questions in class.

**What the heck is a wait time?**

There are two main wait times that you can use when asking questions in class:

## Wait Time \#1

Wait time number 1 is the time after you finish asking your question until your learners respond.

## Wait Time \#2

Wait time number 2 is the time after a learner provides an answer before you say or do anything about that learner's answer.
