# Instructional Design Methodology

I used the instructional design methodology outlined by Rothwell and Kazanas in their book, Mastering the Instructional Design Process - A Systematic Approach ISBN 9780787996468.

The basic steps in this process are:

1. Conduct the training needs assessment - included in the README.md file
1. Assess the relevant learner characteristics - included in the README.md file
1. Assess the relevant work setting characteristics - included in the README.md file
1. Perform a work analysis - skills, knowledge, and attitudes are included in the ksa.md file
1. Write the performance objectives - see objectives.md file
1. Develop performance measurements
1. Sequence the performance objectives
1. Specify the instructional strategies
1. Select or design the instructional materials
1. Evaluate the instruction given
