  ## Introduction
  
  The Boafeng UV-5R has lowered the barrier of entry into becoming an amateur radio operator. 
  
  As of early 2018, this handheld transceiver can be purchased for as little as 25 US dollars.
  
  This video series will go over the basics of using the Baofeng UV-5R whether you are interested in getting your amateur radio license in the near future or if you already have your amateur radio license.
  
  You can watch this entire series from beginning to end or you can pick and choose based on what you need. The videos are super short to make things easier on you.
