# README

This course is produced partly as a way to practice my instructional design skills and partly as a way to help my newfound amateur radio community.

This is a basic course on the use of the Baofeng UV-5R handheld transceiver (HT) for amateur radio (ham) operation.

Since I aim to reach the larget audience possible, I am making this course video based. I am including attribute checklists for any instructor to use as a performance measurement on the psychomotor objectives. Additionally, there are multiple choice exam questions to for performance measurement on the cognitive objectives.

## Audience

This course is intended for:

* Beginner licensed amateur radio operators who wish to receive and transmit on the UV-5R.
* Those who are not yet licensed but are interested in becoming a licensed amateur radio operator who wish to receive (only) on the UV-5R.

This course will enable both groups of learners to use this inexpensive handheld transceiver.

## Training Needs

The product manual that comes with the Boafeng UV-5R does not contain enough information about setting up this device for amateur radio operations.

As a result, beginning amateur radio operators experience difficulty configuring this device to transmit or receive transmissions.

People interested in becoming licensed radio operators experience difficulty configuring this device to receive transmissions.

This training will enable:

* licensed amateur radio operators to configure the UV-5R manually or with a computer using the CHIRP software to transmit and receive via simplex and repeater mode.
* un-licensed radio owners to configure the UV-5R manually or with a computer using the CHIRP software to receive transmissions for listening purposes only.

## Learner Characteristics

This course was designed for learners who:

* Can understand spoken and written English.
* Have vision or have vision-assitive devices that enable them to see the UV-5R LCD screen.
* Have an interest in amateur radio communication.
* Have dexterity enough or can get assistance to find and press the buttons on this device.
* Are familiar with installing software on their computer.
* Are familiar with basic software graphical user interface conventions.
* Will be using this device while inside a home, while being outside, or while riding inside a vehicle.
