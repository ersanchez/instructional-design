# README

This course is produced partly as a way to practice my instructional design skills and partly as a way to help my newfound amateur radio community.

This is a basic course on the use of the Baofeng UV-5R handheld transceiver (HT) for amateur radio (ham) operation.

Since I aim to reach the larget audience possible, I am making this course video based. I am including attribute checklists for any instructor to use as a performance measurement on the psychomotor objectives. Additionally, there are multiple choice exam questions to for performance measurement on the cognitive objectives.

## Audience

This course is intended for:

* Beginner licensed amateur radio operators who wish to receive and transmit on the UV-5R.
* Those who are not yet licensed but are interested in becoming a licensed amateur radio operator who wish to receive (only) on the UV-5R.

This course will enable both groups of learners to use this inexpensive handheld transceiver.

## Training Needs

Beginning amateur radio operators experience difficulty transmitting or receiving transmissions on this radio.

People interested in becoming licensed radio operators experience difficulty receiving transmissions on this radio.

This training will enable amateur radio operators or those interested in becoming licensed radio operators to operate the Baofeng UV-5R HT.

* Can understand spoken and written English.
