# Terminal Objectives

At the end of this course the learner will be able to complete the following major tasks on the Baofeng UV-5R handheld transceiver (HT).

1. Given a Baofeng UV-5R HT, communicate using the Baofeng UV-5R over the amateur radio bands open to a USA FCC Technician's License holder and above in the simplex mode
2. Given a Baofeng UV-5R HT and a list of repeater settings, program repeater settings in the Baofeng UV-5R manually.
3. Given a Baofeng UV-5R HT, a USB connector cable, and a computer with CHIRP software installed, program repeater settings the Baofeng UV-5R using CHIRP software.
4. Given a Baofeng UV-5R HT, with repeater settings programmed in, communicate using the Baofeng UV-5R over the amateur radio bands open to a USA FCC Technician's License holder over a repeater system

Each of these terminal objectives are broken down into enabling objectives which cover the cognitive, affective, and psychomotor skills.

* **psychomotor objectives** - build skills
* **cognitive objectives** - increase the learner's knowledge
* **affective objectives** - aim to change the learner's attitudes
