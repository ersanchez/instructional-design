5. Given a Baofeng UV-5R HT, a USB connector cable, and a computer with CHIRP software installed, change menu settings on the Baofeng UV-5R using CHIRP software.
6. Given a Baofeng UV-5R HT, a USB connector cable, and a computer with CHIRP software installed, program repeater settings on the Baofeng UV-5R using CHIRP software.
7. Given a Baofeng UV-5R HT, with repeater settings programmed in, communicate using the Baofeng UV-5R over the amateur radio bands open to a USA FCC Technician's License holder over a repeater system

Each of these terminal objectives are broken down into enabling objectives which cover the cognitive, affective, and psychomotor skills.

* **Psychomotor objectives** - build skills
* **Cognitive objectives** - increase the learner's knowledge
* **Affective objectives** - aim to change the learner's attitudes
